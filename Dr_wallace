Questions:
	- which gestures should we focus on for our Charades classifier?
	- Motor demands impact speed of information processing in autism spectrum disorders. Neuropsychology, 27, 529-536.


Noisy situation -> sensory overload (covering ears)
	- to teach child appropriate reaction for that scenario


Measuring voice		
	- look at synchrony between gestures and voice
	- temporal and appropriateness 

	- hands over ears & making noise to block out external noise (sirens etc)
	- teeth clenching


excited- arms up, wrists flapping/ rocking + flapping
	- internally overstimulated

handflapping indicates arousal (likely positive, possibly negative)

these are more common with intellectually impaired than ASD

Ivymount School

stimming - moving fingers around fast

asd kids have trouble with proto-declarative pointing; they dont do it
	- a key socio-communicative tool for learning vocabulary

have objects that are age-appropriate for them to interact with

does not look toward others or smile

Neurotypical kids will look at you to learn how they should respond

lack of gestures, functionality

distinguish between more-emotional gestures and more objective (spinning, swimming, drilling)
	- if social/emotional content is involved, ASD kids will use them less

We should video tape; also should integrate voice and facial recognition!!
	
inorganic gestures are prototypical and extreme

ADOS - Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule
	- videotaped
	- 4 modules
		- based on age and verbal ability
		- 1 is for kids
		- 4 is for verbally-fluent adults
	- a standard in ASD diagnostics

Prosody - tone of voice
	- people with ASD are less likely to use prosody
	- questions go 'up' at the end

The coordination of gesture, facial recognition & voice (prosody) are much more indicative of mood than either one alone.

autism speaks video glossary - autism navigator

instrumental gestures - i'd pull you toward the fridge if i wanted something 
	- communicating, but to obtain a goal
	- ASD kids dont have issues with instrumental gestures, but they do with social/emotional gestures

Sensory social routines
